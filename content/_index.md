Howdy! Thanks for stopping by. I'm Brian, and I've been doing technology things since acoustic modem couplers were a thing. I love Open Source and exploring different programming languages. Some highlights about me and my activities:

- Co-founded [GopherCon](https://www.gophercon.com) the largest conference for Go Developers
- Co-authored [Go In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action) for Manning
- Along with [Erik St. Martin](https://erik.dev), I wrote Skynet and SkyDNS, which was eventually morphed into the DNS service discovery that powers Kubernetes
- Contributor to [Virtual Kubelet](https://virtual-kubelet.io/) and [Krustlet](https://krustlet.dev)

I've worked in a lot of interesting industries from Consumer Credit to Healthcare, in jobs ranging from DBA to Chief Information Officer. I'm currently loving life at Microsoft as a Cloud Developer Advocate.

I love to teach because I'm always learning new things. Cloud Advocacy also gives me the freedom to experiment with new and interesting things every day.

My most exciting moment in Open Source came when I got a letter of thanks from the JPL at NASA for a library I wrote. They used it on one of the Rover missions.
